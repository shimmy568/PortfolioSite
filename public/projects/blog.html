    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <h3>It's just a blog I made what kinda title am I supposed to come up with</h3>

        Yep I got a blog, like every other loser on the internet. But I hate myself so I decided to make it without and
        of those WYSIWYG blog makers like wordpress. I decided to make mine with this neat tool called <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>.
        All it basically does is generate a static blog site from a template and a list of markdown files. You can see
        a screenshot of it below.

        Damn, lookin good. I used a theme called archer that can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fi3ework/hexo-theme-archer">here</a>
        I did a little tweaking for the theme just for some photos here and text changes there. Nothing huge for now
        but I may change more in the future. The theme I used is pretty awesome with plenty of features like a sidebar
        and search (which I have yet to add since it requires a separate service). It's also got a nice 404 page,
        plenty of social media options and a nice about me page. I'm not going to screenshot them all that'd take too
        long. Just visit the site yourself to check it out <a href="https://blog.oanderson.me">here</a>.
